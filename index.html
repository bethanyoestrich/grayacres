            <h3> About Gray Acres</h3>
        <p class='about-text long-text'>Gray Acres Hop Yard was started in 2014 with a 3 bines in a residential neighbhorhood in Hamilton County. As the bines grew, so did our interest in the fascinating world of hops! The current hop yard does not allow for much more than hobby production (though our hops have done great wet hopped in homebrews!) but our intention is to move to a larger location that would allow for commercial production in or around 2020. We are currently working to become well versed in best practices prior to upscaling and we are active members in the Indiana Hop Growers Association.

            <h3>Why Indiana Hops?</h3>
            <h4>You drink local craft beer, why wouldn't you want local ingrediants as well?!</h4>
            <p> Indiana has the perfect conditions for growing hops -- long summer days with plently of sunshine, good soil, and winter frosts! Similar to wine, hops express terroir and Indiana hops have a specific palate. While hops are a newer crop in Indiana, several of the large producers provide processed and pelletized hops similar (but obviously better! ) to what the big suppliers provide. </p>
